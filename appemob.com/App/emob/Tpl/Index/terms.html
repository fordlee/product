            <h3>4. MOBILE CAMPAIGN</h3>

            <p>
                <b>4.1</b>
                Publisher acknowledges that Advertiser shall develop all aspects of the Mobile Campaign and shall provide to Appemob all creative and substantive materials (“
                <b>Creative</b>
                ”) required for the marketing of the Mobile Campaign, including but not limited to: icons, links, fields, video, rich media, and any other creative content as required. Accordingly, Publisher acknowledges and agrees that Advertiser alone shall be responsible for the content of its Mobile Campaigns. Publisher hereby releases Appemob from and waives any and all claims and/or demands against Appemob in connection with all aspects of the Mobile Campaign, including without limitation any claims or demands asserting that the Creative violates any relevant rights of any third party, such as intellectual property rights.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>4.2</b>
                Publisher acknowledges that Appemob will track the performance of the Mobile Campaign via its own or a third party’s tracking solution as elected by Appemob and the relevant Advertiser, in their respective sole discretion. Such chosen tracking solution shall form the sole basis for determining the number of Qualified Transactions. In case of any error in the transmission of any tracking data to Appemob (thus preventing Appemob from determining the number of Qualified Transactions), Appemob may determine the number of Qualified Transactions in accordance with other generally accepted industry methods, such as the use of historic analysis of the promotion of Advertiser by Publisher.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>4.3</b>
                Publisher hereby acknowledges and agrees that Appemob reserves the right, in its sole discretion and without liability to reject, omit, exclude or terminate any Mobile Campaign for any reason at any time, whether or not such Mobile Campaign was previously acknowledged, accepted or published by Appemob. Without derogating from the generality of the above, Appemob shall be entitled to so act where it determines that the Mobile Campaign, any content or the Application promoted thereby violates any applicable law, rule, regulation or other judicial or administrative order or the rules or policies of any Store (Apple store or Google Play Store) or where the foregoing may otherwise harm Appemob, its business or reputation.
            </p>

                Unless otherwise stated in these Publisher T&amp;C, Appemob shall pay Publisher for Qualified Transactions a compensation which is based on a revenue share model. This means that Publisher shall be entitled to an agreed upon share of the actual revenue generated by Appemob as a result of the installation and activation of Applications distributed by Publisher as part of the Mobile Campaign, where Appemob shall have the right to retain the remainder share of such income in consideration for its Services. The percentage allocation of the revenue share between Publisher and Appemob shall be separately agreed upon between the parties.

                <b>5.2</b>
                Publisher shall invoice Appemob for its remuneration on a monthly basis based on the reports made available by Appemob to Publisher via the Services. Payment by Appemob is typically being processed within net 10 or net 30 days from Publisher’s invoice; provided that Publisher’s account balance is greater than US$ 200 (in case Publisher elected to receive payment by wire transfer) or US$ 50 (in case Publisher elected to receive payment by Paypal or similar service) (in either case, “
                <b>Minimum Balance</b>
                ”). A balance below the Minimum Balance, will roll over to the next month, and will continue to roll over monthly until the Minimum Balance is reached.
