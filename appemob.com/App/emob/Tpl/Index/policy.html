    this Agreement.
</p>

    ("Services App(s)"), based upon the criteria selected by You and/or Your advertisers via the protocol and/or
    user interface provided by appemob for accessing the Services. This protocol and/or user interface may be
    updated by appemob from time to time without notice to you ("Services Interface"). If you are an advertiser
    during the Services Term, you will provide Services Ads for display on the Services Apps.
</p>

<h3> Implementation of Services</h3>

<p>
    You will implement the Services in a manner that complies with the technical and implementation requirements
    provided on the Site or in writing by appemob to You from time to time, including those instructions
    contained in the documentation regarding the Services Interface. Without limiting the foregoing, You
    acknowledge and agree to the following:</p>

<p>
    a) Services Obligations. In order for the Services to work correctly on mobile platforms, You must provide
    the following information with every ad request: (i) a Unique Device Identifier or other Device ID, (ii) Ad
    Unit ID, mapped to the correct application that is in use by the end user, (iii) device type, (iv) language,
    (v) OS version, (vi) SDK version, (vii) device model, (viii) display type and (ix) country. You must also
    notify appemob when an application is opened by the user. You will be solely responsible for all, without
    limitation, Services Ad content, Services Ad information, Services Ad URLs, editorial, text, graphic,
    audiovisual, and other content and any other information You enter into the Services, whether generated by
    or for You ("Services Data"). You will protect any Services accounts, usernames or passwords and take full
    responsibility for Your own, and third party, use of any Services accounts, usernames or passwords. You will
    obtain appemob's prior written consent (to include email) for any third party use of the Services except for
    (i) a third party's use solely to provide analytics information for Your Apps and (ii) a bona fide
    advertising agency's use. If You permit any third party to access your Services account, you agree that You
    are liable for any such third party usage. You will not permit access to the third party unless and until it
    agrees to comply with appemob's terms and conditions. Any data collected or accessed through the Services
    must be directly accessible by appemob. Your use of an intermediary who has sole direct access to user data
    arising from the Services is prohibited.</p>

<p>
    b) Policies. appemob will have no obligation to process a request for Services Ads that are not sent in
    compliance with the requirements of this Agreement. While appemob does not intend, and does not undertake,
    to monitor the Services Ads and/or Services Data, if appemob is notified by You or otherwise becomes aware
    and determines in its sole discretion that the Services Ads and/or Services Data or any portion of the
    Services Ads and/or Services Data or Your trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and
    other distinctive brand features: (i) violates the intellectual property rights or any other rights of any
    third party; (ii) violates any applicable law or is subject to an injunction; (iii) is pornographic, obscene
    or otherwise violates this Agreement; (iv) is being distributed by You improperly; or (v) may create
    liability for appemob, appemob may reject, remove, withdraw from, not display or cease displaying that
    Services Ad and/or Services Data from the Services entirely with no liability to appemob. You will have and
    abide by an appropriate privacy policy and will comply with all applicable laws relating to the collection
    and use of information from end users of Services App(s). You must post a privacy policy in each Services
    App and such policy must provide notice of Your use of a cookie or other mechanism for a third party to
    collect end user traffic data.</p>

<p>
    c) Prohibited Actions. You will not, and will not allow any third party to: (a) directly or indirectly
    access, launch and/or activate the Services through or from, or otherwise incorporate the Services in, any
    software application, website or other means other than the Services App(s), and then only to the extent
    expressly permitted herein; (b) transfer, sell, lease, syndicate, sub-syndicate, lend, or use for co-
    branding, timesharing, service bureau or other unauthorized purposes the Services or access thereto
    (including, but not limited to ads, including without limitation Services Ads, or any part, copy or
    derivative thereof); (c) directly or indirectly generate queries, or impressions of or clicks on ads,
    including without limitation Services Ads, through any automated, deceptive, fraudulent or other invalid
    means (including, but not limited to, click spam, robots, macro Services, and Internet agents); (d)

    ads, including without limitation Services Ads, through offering incentives or any other methods that are
    manipulative, deceptive, malicious or fraudulent; (e) modify, adapt, translate, prepare derivative works
    from, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise attempt to derive source code from the Services,
    appemobʼs then current protocol for accessing and implementing the Services (the "appemob Protocol"), or any
    other appemob technology, content, data, routines, algorithms, methods, ideas design, user interface
    techniques, software, materials, and documentation; (f) remove, deface, obscure, or alter appemobʼs
    copyright notice, trademarks or other proprietary rights notices affixed to or provided as a part of the
    Services, the appemob Protocol, or any other appemob technology, software, materials and documentation; (g)
    create or attempt to create a substitute or similar service or product through use of or access to any of
    the Services or proprietary information related thereto; or (h) utilize any feature or functionality of the
    Online Services, or include anything in Services Data or Services Ads, that could be so utilized, to
    personally identify and/or personally track individual end users or any other persons.</p>

<p>
    d) Restrictions. You must use the Services only for serving advertisements and promotions to Services Apps.
    You may use the Services only with free Apps. You may not use the Services to serve other content. You may

    against a particular group , (iii) infringe a third party's rights, (iv) introduce viruses, spyware, and
    malware, (v) contain sexually explicit content, (vi) depict illicit drugs and drug paraphernalia, (vii)

    could harm minors in any way, or (xi) contain any content that is illegal, promotes illegal activity,
    misleading, inaccurate, or infringes on the legal rights of others.</p>

<p>
    e) No Endorsement. appemob does not represent or endorse any ads, links, content, advice, opinion, offer,
    proposal, statement, data or other information from any third party products/services ("Disclaimed Content")
    that is displayed or distributed through Online Services. appemob hereby disclaims any liability or
    responsibility for any Disclaimed Content. appemob reserves the right, but will have no responsibility, to
    edit, modify, refuse to post or remove any Disclaimed Content, in whole or in part, that in appemob, in its
    sole and absolute discretion, deems is objectionable, erroneous, illegal, fraudulent or otherwise in
    violation of this Agreement.</p>

<p>
    Services Term. This Agreement will be effective as of the date appemob activates Your Services account and
    will continue until terminated as provided in this Agreement (the " Services Term"). You may terminate this
    Agreement, with or without cause, at any time by sending written notice of Your desire to cancel Your
    participation in the Services to info@appemob.com. This Agreement will be deemed terminated within ten (10)
    business days of appemobʼs receipt of Your notice. If You violate this Agreement, appemob may in its sole
    discretion, without notice, terminate this Agreement, or suspend or terminate the participation of Your
    Services App in all or part of the Services. In addition, appemob may terminate this Agreement, or suspend
    or terminate the participation of Your Services App in all or part of the Services, with or without cause,
    upon thirty (30) dayʼs prior notice. Services Advertiser Obligations. You will be solely responsible for all
    matters related to Your third party advertisers who provide advertisements to You in connection with the
    Services ("Services Advertisers"), including without limitation the solicitation and trafficking of Services
    Ads, billing and payment of Services Advertisers, providing all technical support services to Services
    Advertisers, and handling all other inquiries and disputes of any type or nature. Services Fee. Some of the
    services in the Services require payment of fees. appemob reserves the right to change its price list and to
    institute new charges at any time, upon thirty (30) days prior notice to You, which may be sent by email or
    posted on the Site. If You are an advertiser, You will pre-pay all applicable fees, as described on the Site
    unless otherwise agreed to in writing by an authorized appemob representative. If You are an advertiser and
    choose to run a Cost Per Install ("CPI") campaign without having properly integrated the appemob SDK for
    tracking purposes, You will be charged $0.10 per click for all the clicks delivered in that campaign, and
    the campaign will be automatically terminated when detected. Impressions and clicks are tracked instantly.
    Installs are tracked whenever a user opens the application they have downloaded. appemob will keep the
    install loop open for a period of 21 days. During this time, installs will still be reported for campaigns
    that might be off (not displaying any new impressions) but the advertiser will still be accountable for the
    install and the publisher will be paid for installs coming from clicks that they delivered in the past. This
    only affects CPI campaigns, not Cost Per Click ("CPC").</p>

<p>
    If You are a publisher of network advertising campaigns, You will receive a percentage of Net Revenue. "Net
    Revenue" means revenues actually received by appemob from the sale, use or other disposition of
    advertisements that are part of network advertising campaigns displayed on publisher's Services App less
    taxes, agency commissions, carrier and/or partner fees, and any allowances actually made or taken for
    returns, cash discounts or promotional allowances. The portion of Net Revenue received by publisher shall be
    determined on the first day of each calendar month, on which day those revenues accrued to publisher's in
    the previous month shall become eligible to be paid. Until notified in writing otherwise, the portion of Net
    Revenue paid is seventy percent (70%). Payments to publisher shall be sent by appemob only if publisher's
    earned balance is greater than or equal to $200 (Two Hundred US Dollars). If publisher's earned balance is
    less than $200, no payment shall be sent until the following calendar month, on the first day of which
    appemob shall make the aforesaid determination anew. In addition, if You are a publisher, You agree that any
    payments that may become due to You are specifically conditioned upon appemob's receipt of full payment from
    the applicable advertiser. If appemob does not receive the applicable payment in full from any such
    advertiser, appemob shall have no liability or responsibility to publisher (and publisher hereby releases
    appemob) with respect thereto. Payment shall be calculated solely based on records maintained by appemob. No
    other measurements or statistics of any kind shall be accepted by appemob or have any effect under this
    Agreement. appemob shall not be liable for any payment based on (i) any fraudulent impressi ons generated by
    any person, robot, automated Services or similar device or for fraudulent impressions similarly generated on
    any advertisements, as reasonably determined by appemob; (ii) impressions commingled with a significant
    number of fraudulent impressions or fraudulent clicks described in (i) above; or (iii) any breach of this
    Agreement by You. If payment is by electronic bank transfer, appemob is not responsible for any associated
    fees charged by your banking institution.</p>

<p>
    Cross-Promotion Advertising. If you are a publisher of network advertising campaigns you have the option to
    reinvest a set portion of your earned balance toward CPC campaigns at the rate established by appemob and
    that may be amended from time to time. Cross-promotion campaigns may be turned on or off at any time. Once
    turned on, the cost of each click will be deducted from the earned balance in a near real-time manner.
    License to Services Interface. appemob grants to You a limited, revocable, non-transferable, non-exclusive
    and non-sublicensable license during the Services Term to use the Services Interface solely for the purpose
    of transmitting Services Requests and other required information and receiving Services Results Sets solely
    to the extent permitted hereunder. Except to the limited extent expressly provided in this Agreement,
    appemob does not grant, and You will not acquire, any right, title or interest (including, without
    limitation, any implied license) in or to any appemob intellectual property rights; and all rights not
    expressly granted herein are reserved to appemob.</p>

<p>

    governmental authority. Neither party will use the other party's name and logo in any news release, public
    announcement, advertisement, or other form of publicity without the prior written consent of the other party
    (which includes email), except that either party may use the other party's name and logo on such party's
    website and in publicity that announces the parties are working together. In addition, appemob may use any
    content used with the Services in any form of publicity.</p>

    appemob does not give or enter into any conditions, warranties or other terms with regard to the Services.
    In particular, no condition, warranty or other term is given or entered into to the effect that the Services

    WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER TORT, BREACH OF ANY STATUTORY DUTY, INDEMNITY OR
    CONTRIBUTION, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME
    STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE
    LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS IN THIS AND THE FOREGOING PARAGRAPH MAY NOT APPLY.</p>

<p>
    In any event, each party's total cumulative liability to the other party for any loss or damages resulting
    from any claims, demands, or actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement will not exceed the net
    amount paid by You to appemob in the six month period immediately preceding the date of the claim.

    the Services Term all end user consents and all rights, authorizations and licenses (including without

    perform the obligations to which it commits herein; and (ii) its Services Interface will not knowingly
    violate the intellectual property rights of any third party.</p>

<p>
    Miscellaneous. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Cyprus
    without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. Neither partyʼs waiver of any default is a
    waiver of any subsequent default. Unenforceable provisions will be modified to reflect the partiesʼ
    intention, and remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full effect. You may not assign any of
    Your rights hereunder and any such attempt is void (except to Your successor in the event of Your merger,

        users, you hereby consent to the transfer of such information to the United States and represent and warrant
        that you have obtained all required end user consents. Registration: During the registration process on our
        Sites, you may be asked for certain information, which may include your name, your email address, the company
        for which you work, your country, and a password. This registration information is used to validate customers
        when they visit the Sites. It may also be used to send you additional promotional information about our
        services. If you were entered in a appemob promotion in connection with your registration, we will also use your
        name and email address to contact you if you have won a prize in that promotion, and will ask you for the
        address at which you would like to receive your prize. We store all data associated with your account, including
        your contact information, your applications and your campaigns. Cookies and Beacons: A "cookie" is a small text
        file that contains a string of alphanumeric characters. There are two types of cookies that may be used at the
        appemob Sites: a persistent cookie and a session cookie. A persistent cookie gets entered by your Web browser
        into the "Cookies" folder on your computer and remains in this "Cookies" folder after you close your browser.
        Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Sites. A session cookie is held
        temporarily in your computer's memory and disappears after you close your browser or shut off your computer. The
        Sites may also use Web beacons (also called "clear GIFs" or "pixel tags") in conjunction with cookies. Web
        beacons are small strings of code that are placed in a Web page. If you have arrived at the Sites by clicking on
        a banner ad for one of our products or services, a session cookie may be used. This cookie will contain an
        identification number for the ad that you clicked on, or will contain an identification number for the Sites
        that you were visiting when you clicked on the banner ad. This session cookie helps appemob determine which of
        our ads attract the most visitors. If, after you arrive at our Sites, you choose to request further information
        from us about our products and services, the information that you provide in that request will be linked to the
        information in the session cookie. This also helps appemob measure the effectiveness of our advertising. Because
        this is a session cookie, it will disappear once you have closed your browser. appemob Sites may use persistent
        cookies, Web beacons and information collected in our log files (such as Internet Protocol Address, referring
        URLs, etc.) about your activity at the Sites to better un derstand how the Sites are used, resolve technical
        problems, and enhance your experience at the Sites. We may use a third-party email technology to send emails
        that you have agreed to receive. Web beacons are used in those email messages to measure the effectiveness of
        our advertising. In addition, appemob may serve ads on the Sites using our own ad serving technology. In doing
        so, one of our ad servers will place or read a unique ad-serving cookie on your computer and will use
        information about your browser and your activity at the Sites. The ad serving cookie is a persistent cookie.
        Services: When an ad is served through our Online Services, we may collect the following from your end users'
        devices: bundle id, language id, operating system version, device model, software developer kit (sdk) version,
        unique device identifier, IP address, and Media Access Control (MAC) address. The information we access and
        collect may determine the nature of the ad that the end user sees. For example, we use the IP address to create
        a country code to help advertisers target advertising campaigns by country. We may generate a cookie based on a
        device identifier or use other technologies to record information about the ads an end user is shown, as well as
        the ads an end user clicks and other actions the end user takes within the application. We share device
        identifiers and a hash of the MAC address with advertisers so that they can track average revenue per user
        (ARPU) and life time value (LTV) for the end users they acquire through the advertisements. All of the
        information we collect about your end users is presented to you through a dashboard (accessible through your
        account) including information analyzed by our analytics service (currently provided by a third party). You
        cannot access data about the end users of another customer through the Online Services. In the appemob software
        developer kit developers may download into their applications to access our Online Services, we offer developers
        the option to enable an opt-out from any tracking for end users. We encourage you to take advantage of this
        option or implement one of your own.
    </p>

    <h3> 2. INFORMATION SHARING OR DISCLOSURE</h3>

    <p> In the event that we contract with a third party to provide some part of the service that you have requested or
        to assist us in analyzing our service or information collected about you and/or your end users, appemob may
        provide your information and/or your end user information to such third party, or such third party may collect
        information from you or the end users on our behalf. We may share your information and end user information with
        third parties with whom we have a strategic relationship, such as advertisers. The information shared with these
        third parties may be used for industry analysis, tracking ad conversions or demographic profiling. We may also
        provide your information and end user information to our business partners or other trusted entities for the
        purpose of providing you with information on goods and services we believe will be of interest to you. We will
        disclose any information about you or your end users to government or law enforcement officials or private
        parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process
        (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of appemob or any third party, to
        protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose
        a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable. In addition, we may disclose information to third
        parties in connection with a corporate re-organization, merger or amalgamation, or the sale of all or
        substantially all of our assets. Finally, we may share aggregate or anonymous information about you or your end
        users with advertisers, publishers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties.
